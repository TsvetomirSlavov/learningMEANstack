# learningMEANstack
Learning MEAN stack through michaelcheng429's MEAN stack tutorial.

I started off with meanio and it gave me a lot of things I do not need for this tutorial, so I removed a lot of the unnecessary files. Through this tutorial I really enjoy using the MEAN stack and will be using it for future projects.
